    <abstract>
      <t> Electronic mail is one of the oldest Internet
      applications that is still in very active use.  While the
      basic protocols and formats for mail transport and message
      formats have evolved slowly over the years, events and
      thinking in more recent years have supplemented those core
      protocols with additional features and suggestions for their
      use.
      This Applicability Statement describes the relationship
      among many of those protocols and provides guidance and
      makes recommendations for the use of features of the core
      protocols.</t>

      <name>Applicability of Some SMTP Provisions</name>
      <t> Over the years since <xref target="RFC5321"/> was
        published in October 2008, usage of SMTP has evolved, machines and 
	network speeds have increased, and the frequency with which
	SMTP senders and receivers have to be prepared to deal with
	systems that are disconnected from the Internet for long
	periods or that require many hops to reach has decreased.
	During the same period, the IETF

	<!-- Could say "Internet" above, but I'm not sure it would be true -->

	has become much more sensitive to privacy and security
	issues and the need to be more resistant or robust against
	spam and other attacks.  In addition SMTP (and Message
	Format) extensions have been introduced that are expected to
	evolve the Internet's mail system to better accommodate
	environments in which Basic Latin Script is not the
	norm.</t>
      <t> This section describes adjustments
	that may be appropriate for SMTP under various circumstances
	and discusses the applicability of other protocols that
	represent newer work or that are intended to deal with
	relatively newer issues.</t>

        <name>Handling of the Domain Argument to the EHLO Command</name>
        <t> If the <tt>Domain</tt> argument to

          DNS that matches the IP address of the client, the SMTP
          server may refuse any mail from the client as part of
          established anti-abuse practice.
          Operational experience has demonstrated that the lack of
          a matching address record for the the domain name
          argument is at best an indication of a poorly-configured
          MTA, and at worst that of an abusive host. </t>

        <name>Use of Addresses in Top-Level Domains</name>
        <t> While addresses in top-level domains (TLDs) are
          syntactically valid, mail to these addresses has never
          worked reliably.
          A handful of country code TLDs have top level MX records but
          they have never been widely used nor 
          well supported. In 2013 <xref target="RFC7085"/> found 18
          TLDs with MX records, which dropped to 17 in 2021 despite
          many new TLDs having been added. </t>
        <t> Mail sent to addresses with single label domains has
          typically expected the address to be an abbreviation to be
          completed by a search list, so mail to bob@sales would be
          completed to bob@sales.example.com.
          This shortcut has led to unfortunate consequnces; in one
          famous case, in 1991 when the .CS domain was added to the
          root, mail in computer science departments started to fail
          as mail to bob@cs was now treated as mail to
          Czechoslovakia.
          Hence, for reliable service, mail SHOULD NOT use addreses
          that contain single label domains. </t>

        <name>Use of SMTP Extensions</name>
        <t>As SMTP has evolved over the years, several extensions
          have become ubiquitous.
          As a result, the following extensions MUST be supported by SMTP
          senders and receivers:

        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <xref target="RFC6152">8-bit MIME</xref></li>
          <li>
            <xref target="RFC3461">Deliver Status Notifications</xref></li>
        </ul>
        <t>Similarly, the following extensions SHOULD be supported by SMTP
          senders and receivers:

        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <xref target="RFC2920">Command Pipelining</xref></li>
          <li>
            <xref target="RFC6531">Internationalized Email</xref></li>
        </ul>
        <t>Furthermore, while Enhanced Mail System Status Codes
          (<xref target="RFC3463"/>, <xref target="RFC5248"/>)
          are widely supported, they are not ubiquitous.
          Nevertheless, they have been found to be useful to SMTP
          senders in determining the exact reason for a transmission
          failure in a machine-readable, language-independent manner,
          thus allowing them to present more detailed and
          language-specific error messages to users. 

          Given the usefulness of these enhanced codes, SMTP receivers
          are RECOMMENDED to implement the <xref target="RFC2034">SMTP
          Service Extension for Returning Enhanced Error Codes</xref>
          utilizing the codes registered in <xref target="RFC5248"/>.

            While it allows for empty quoted string, such construct is
            going to cause interoperability issues when used in certain
            header fields.
            In particular, use of empty quoted  strings is NOT

            header field), "keywords" (a component of a Keywords header
            field) and "local-part" (left hand side of email addresses).
            Use of empty quoted strings is in particular problematic in
            the "local-part".
            For example, all of the following email addresses are non

        <name>Case-Sensitivity, Delimiters, and Mailbox Equivalency</name>

        <t>SMTP specifies that the local-part of an email address is
      case-sensitive (see
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-emailcore-rfc5321bis" 
            section="2.4" sectionFormat="of"/>):</t>

      <sourcecode>
        The local-part of a mailbox MUST BE treated as case
        sensitive.  Therefore, SMTP implementations MUST take
        care to preserve the case of mailbox local-parts.
        In particular, for some hosts, the user "smith" is
        different from the user "Smith".  However, exploiting
        the case sensitivity of mailbox local-parts impedes
        interoperability and is discouraged.
      </sourcecode>

      <t>While case-sensitivity is specified as an absolute
      requirement, it is important to stress that most
      implementations do not make case distinctions in local parts
      (most treat “smith”, “Smith”, and “SMITH” as the same), and
      most implementations do preserve the case that is received
      (from SMTP or HTTP, from address books, or from user
      input).
      Maximum interoperability will be achieved by keeping local-parts
      unchanged (and especially making no attempt to change their case
      in any way) and by assuming that local-parts that differ only in
      their case probably refer to the same mailbox.
      This is particularly important for software that validates
      user-input fields, where case changes are tempting, but must
      be avoided.</t>

      <t>It is also important to note, as we encounter non-ASCII
      local-parts over time, that case changes are both
      character-set dependent and language dependent, and attempts
      to change case without having the full context necessary are
      likely to be wrong often enough to matter.</t>

      <t>Additionally, final delivery systems vary in how they interpret
        the use of delimiters such as '+' and '.' in local-parts.
        Some systems make distinctions between local-parts
        such as "smith" and "smith+foo", or "jane.doe" and "janedoe",
        while others treat them as referring to the same mailboxes
        respectively.
        Since only the final delivery system can properly interpret
        the local-part of an address, originating and transit/relay
        mail systems are discouraged from making any assumptions as to
        address equivalency or from making any changes to local-parts
        containing such delimiters.</t>
      </section>

      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Use and Validation in HTML and Other Contexts</name>

        <t>Email addresses are frequently used as input in HyperText
        Markup Language (HTML) forms but the allowed grammar
        of these email addresses is more restrictive than the
        grammar for a 'Mailbox' in
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-emailcore-rfc5321bis" section="4.1.2"/>
        (the lack of quoted strings and limited characters allowed in
        domains).
        Implementations that intend to accept email addresses in HTML
        forms are encouraged to consult the valid email address
        grammar in
        <xref target="HTML" section="4.10.5.1.5"
              relative="#valid-e-mail-address"/>.</t>

        <t>Additionally, the following general guidance is provided:</t>

        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Few mail systems allow leading, trailing, or
          consecutive unquoted dots ('.') in the local-part of
          email addresses even though the HTML grammar referenced
          above currently allows them.
          Consequently, implementations are discouraged from accepting
          such addresses.</li>

          <li>Some mail systems allow a trailing dot ('.') in the
          domain part of email addresses (as allowed by
          <xref target="RFC1035">Domain Names</xref>), but this is
          not interoperable with all systems.
          Consequently, implementations are encouraged to strip trailing

      <t>SMTP is specified without embedded mechanisms for
        authentication or confidentiality; its traffic is therefore
        "in the clear". Years of operational experience have shown
        that such transmission exposes the message to easy compromise,
        including wiretapping and spoofing. To mitigate these risks,
        operation of SMTP has evolved over the years so that it is

          identity of one or more of the endpoints of a communication
          channel. TLS only requires authentication of the server side
          of the communication channel; authentication of the client
          side is optional.</li>
        <li>The term "confidentiality" describes a state where the
          data (i.e., the message) is transmitted in a way that it is
          only visible to the endpoints of a communication
          channel.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>It is not uncommon for implementers to use the term
        "encryption" to mean "confidentiality", but this is not quite
        correct. Rather, encryption using TLS is the current method by
        which confidentiality is achieved with SMTP, but that does not
        mean that future methods might not be developed.</t>
      <t>Note: With typical email use of TLS, authentication only is
        performed for the target receiving server and is not done for
        the sending client. That is, it serves to validate that the
        connection has been made to the intended server, but does not
        validate who initiated it.</t>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Optional Confidentiality</name>
        <t>The most common implementation of message confidentiality
          is what's known as "opportunistic TLS", which is frequently
          referred to as "opportunistic encryption". With this method,
          a receiving server announces in its greeting that it is
          capable of supporting TLS encryption through the presence of
          the "STARTTLS" keyword. The sending client then attempts to
          negotiate an encrypted connection, and if successful,
          transmits the message in encrypted form; if negotiation
          fails, the client falls back to sending the message in clear
          text.</t>
        <t>Opportunistic TLS is confidentiality without
          authentication, because no effort is made to authenticate
          the receiving server, and it is optional confidentiality due
          to the ability to fall back to transmission in the clear if
          a secure connection cannot be established. That said, most
          modern implementations of SMTP support this method,
          especially at the largest mailbox providers, and so the vast
          majority of email traffic is encrypted during its time
          transiting from the client to the server.</t>
        <t>Note: While TLS provides protection while the message is
          in transit, there is no guarantee that the message will be
          stored in encrypted fashion at its destination. In fact,
          storage in plain text should be expected!</t>
      </section>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Required Confidentiality, with Receiving Server Authentication</name>
        <t>Two protocols exist that move message confidentiality
          from optional to required (with conditions as noted below) -
          <xref target="RFC8461">MTA-STS</xref> and
          <xref target="RFC7672">DANE for SMTP</xref>.
          While they differ in their implementation details, receiving
          servers relying on either protocol are stating that they
          only accept mail if the transmission can be encrypted with
          TLS, and a failure to negotiate a secure connection MUST
          result in the sending client refusing to transmit the
          message. Support for both protocols is increasing, but is
          not yet mandatory.</t>
        <t>These two protocols differ from Opportunistic TLS in that
          they require receiving server authentication and there is no
          fallback to sending in the clear if negotiation of an
          encrypted connection fails.</t>
        <t>Note: Both protocols mentioned in this section rely not
          only on the receiving server but also the sending client
          supporting the protocol intended to be used. If the sending
          client does not implement or understand the protocol
          requested by the receiving server, the sending client will
          use Opportunistic TLS or clear-text to transmit the
          message.</t>
      </section>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Message-Level Authentication</name>
        <t>Protocols exist to allow for authentication of different
          identities associated with an email message -
          <xref target="RFC7208">SPF</xref> and
          <xref target="RFC6376">DKIM</xref>.
          A third protocol, <xref target="RFC7489">DMARC</xref>,
          relies on SPF and DKIM to allow for validation of the domain
          in the visible From header, and a fourth,
          <xref target="RFC8617">ARC</xref>, provides a way for each
          hop to record results of authentication checks performed at
          that hop.</t>
        <t>All of these are outside the scope of this document, as
          they are outside the scope of SMTP. They deal with
          validating the authorized usage of one or more domains in an
          email message, and not with establishing the identity of the
          receiving server.</t>
      </section>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>SMTP Authentication</name>
        <t><xref target="RFC4954">SMTP Authentication</xref>,
          which is often abbreviated as SMTP AUTH,
          is an extension to SMTP. While its name might suggest
          that it would be within scope for this section of the
          Applicability Statement, nothing could be further from the
          truth.</t>
        <t>SMTP AUTH defines a method for a client to identify
          itself to a Message Submission Agent (MSA) when presenting a
          message for transmission, usually using port 587 rather than
          the traditional port 25. The most common implementation of
          SMTP AUTH is for a person to present a username and password
          to their mailbox provider's outbound SMTP server when
          configuring their MUA for sending mail.</t>
      </section>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Message-Level Confidentiality</name>
        <t>Protocols such as <xref target="RFC8551">S/MIME</xref>
          and <xref target="RFC4880">OpenPGP</xref> exist to allow for
          message confidentiality outside of the operation of
          SMTP. That is to say, using these protocols results in
          encryption of the message prior to its being submitted to
          the SMTP communications channel, and decryption of the
          message is the responsibility of the message
          recipient. There are numerous implementations of these
          protocols, too many to list here. As they operate fully
          independent of SMTP, they are out of scope for this
          document.</t>

        It was agreed upon that it was time to create a working group
