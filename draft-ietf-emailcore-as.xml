      <t> Electronic mail is one of the oldest Internet
      applications that is still in very active use.  While the
      basic protocols and formats for mail transport and message
      formats have evolved slowly over the years, events and
      thinking in more recent years have supplemented those core
      protocols with additional features and suggestions for their
      use.
      This Applicability Statement describes the relationship
      among many of those protocols and provides guidance and
      makes recommendations for the use of features of the core
      protocols.</t>

      <name>Applicability of Some SMTP Provisions</name>
      <t> Over the years since <xref target="RFC5321"/> was
        published in October 2008, usage of SMTP has evolved,
		machines and
	  <!-- 20250226 JcK -->		
        network speeds have increased, and the frequency with which most
        SMTP senders and receivers have to be prepared to deal with
        systems that are disconnected from the Internet for long
        periods or that require many hops to reach has decreased.
        During the same period, the IETF

        <!-- Could say "Internet" above, but I'm not sure it would be true -->

        has become much more sensitive to privacy and security
        issues and the need to be more resistant or robust against
        spam and other attacks.  In addition SMTP (and Message
        Format) extensions have been introduced that are expected to
        evolve the Internet's mail system to better accommodate
        environments in which Basic Latin Script is not the norm.
      </t>

	  <t> This section describes

		 describes configuration options and other considerations
		 about SMTP that may be appropriate under various circumstances
      and discusses the applicability of other protocols that
      represent newer work or that are intended to deal with
      relatively newer issues.</t>

        <name>Handling of the Domain Argument to the EHLO Command</name>
        <t> If the <tt>Domain</tt> argument to
          the EHLO command does not have an address record in the
          DNS that matches the IP address of the client, the SMTP
          server may refuse any mail from the client as part of
          established anti-abuse practice.
          Operational experience has demonstrated that the lack of
          a matching address record for the the domain name
          argument is at best an indication of a poorly-configured
          MTA, and at worst that of an abusive host. </t>

          they are deemed to be signs of at best a misconfigured

        <name>Use of Addresses in Top-Level Domains</name>
		<t> While addresses in top-level domains (TLDs)
		   <!-- 20250226 JcK -->
		    (i.e., single-label domains) are
          syntactically valid, mail to these addresses has never
          worked reliably.
          A handful of country code TLDs have top level MX records but
          they have never been widely used nor 
          well supported. In 2013 <xref target="RFC7085"/> found 18
          TLDs with MX records, which dropped to 17 in 2021 and to
          11 in 2025 despite many new TLDs having been added. </t>
        <t> Mail sent to addresses with single label domains has
          typically expected the address to be an abbreviation to be
          completed by a search list, so mail to bob@sales would be
          completed to bob@sales.example.com.
          This shortcut has led to unfortunate consequnces; in one
          famous case, in 1991 when the .CS domain was added to the
          root, mail in computer science departments started to fail
          as mail to bob@cs was now treated as mail to
          Czechoslovakia.
		  <!-- 20250226 JcK  (typo corrected) -->
		  Hence, for reliable service, mail SHOULD NOT use addresses
          that contain single label domains. </t>

        <name>Use of SMTP Extensions</name>
        <t>As SMTP has evolved over the years, several extensions

        <t><xref target="RFC3461">Delivery Status Notifications</xref>
        requests, while recommended and useful if supported, have not
        been widely implemented and deployed.
        Mail systems that send such requests should be prepared for
        systems that receive them to not recognize or support them.
        Note that this extension for notification requests is distinct
        from the format of notifications defined in
        <xref target="RFC3464"/> and <xref target="RFC6533"/>
        and, the special media type defined in <xref target="RFC6522"/>.
        All of those SHOULD be supported.
        </t>

        <t>Furthermore, while Enhanced Mail System Status Codes
          (<xref target="RFC3463"/>, <xref target="RFC5248"/>)
          are widely supported, they are not ubiquitous.
          Nevertheless, they have been found to be useful to SMTP
          senders in determining the exact reason for a transmission
          failure in a machine-readable, language-independent manner,
          thus allowing them to present more detailed and
          language-specific error messages to users. 

          Given the usefulness of these enhanced codes, SMTP receivers
          are RECOMMENDED to implement the <xref target="RFC2034">SMTP
          Service Extension for Returning Enhanced Error Codes</xref>
          utilizing the codes registered in <xref target="RFC5248"/>.

            grammar.
            While it allows for empty quoted string, such construct is
            going to cause interoperability issues when used in certain
            header fields.
            In particular, use of empty quoted  strings is discouraged
            in "received-token" (a component of a Received
            header field) and "local-part" (left hand side of email addresses).
            For example, all of the following email header fields are
            non-interoperable:
        </t>

        <ul empty="true">
          <li>Received: from node.example by x.y.test "" foo; 21 Nov 1997 10:01:22 -0600</li>
	  <li>From: "".bar@example.com</li>
	  <li>To: foo.""@example.net</li>
	  <li>Cc: ""@example.com</li>
        </ul>

        <t>Use of empty quoted strings is fine in "display-name".
        For example, the following email header field is interoperable:</t>

        <ul empty="true">
          <li>To: "" &lt;test@example.com&gt;</li>
        </ul>

        <section numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Generation</name>
          <t>Email addresses are commonly classified as Personally
          Identifiable Information (PII). Improper application of the
          FOR clause in Received header fields can result in disclosure
          of PII.  As such, the FOR clause SHOULD NOT be generated if the
          message copy is associated with multiple recipients from
          multiple SMTP RCPT commands.
          Otherwise, the value of the FOR clause MUST contain the RCPT
          address that caused the message to be routed to the
          recipient of the given copy of the message.</t>

          <t>Note however, that if a mail system generates a FOR clause
          when there is only a single recipient, and doesn't generate
          one when there are multiple recipients, the absence of the
          field is an indication that there is another recipient, which
          may allow someone to infer that a "blind" copy is
          involved.</t>

        <section anchor="received-consumption" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Consumption</name>
          <t>Received header fields support analysis of handling and
          delivery problems, as well as aiding evaluation of a message
          with suspicious content or attributes. The fields are easily
          created and have no direct security or privacy protections,
          and the fields can contain personally sensitive
          information.
          </t>

          <t>Therefore, the fields do not warrant automatic trust and
          do warrant careful consideration before disclosing to

      <sourcecode>
        The local-part of a mailbox MUST BE treated as case
        sensitive.  Therefore, SMTP implementations MUST take
        care to preserve the case of mailbox local-parts.
        In particular, for some hosts, the user "smith" is
        different from the user "Smith".  However, exploiting
        the case sensitivity of mailbox local-parts impedes
        interoperability and is discouraged.
      </sourcecode>

      <t>While case-sensitivity is specified as an absolute
      requirement, it is important to stress that most
      implementations do not make case distinctions in local parts
      (most treat "smith", "Smith", and "SMITH" as the same), and
      most implementations do preserve the case that is received
      (from SMTP or HTTP, from address books, or from user
      input).
      Maximum interoperability will be achieved by keeping local-parts
      unchanged (and especially making no attempt to change their case
      in any way) and by assuming that local-parts that differ only in
      their case probably refer to the same mailbox.
      This is particularly important for software that validates
      user-input fields, where case changes are tempting, but must
      be avoided.</t>

      <t>It is also important to note, as we encounter non-ASCII
      local-parts over time, that case changes are both
      character-set dependent and language dependent, and attempts
      to change case without having the full context necessary are
      likely to be wrong often enough to matter.</t>

      <t>Additionally, final delivery systems vary in how they interpret
        the use of delimiters such as '+' and '.' in local-parts.
        Some systems make distinctions between local-parts
        such as "smith" and "smith+foo", or "jane.doe" and "janedoe",
        while others treat them as referring to the same mailboxes
        respectively.
        Since only the final delivery system can properly interpret
        the local-part of an address, originating and transit/relay
        mail systems are discouraged from making any assumptions as to
        address equivalency or from making any changes to local-parts
        containing such delimiters.</t>

        <t>The following sections discuss these facilities and their
        most common uses.</t>

        <section anchor="tls" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Transport Layer Security</name>
          <t>SMTP has evolved over the years so that it is
          used with the benefit of
          <xref target="RFC8446">Transport Layer Security (TLS)</xref>
          to provide both confidentiality and authentication in the
          transmission of messages.</t>

          <t>It is important that the reader understand what is meant by
          the terms "Authentication" and "Confidentiality", and for that
          we will borrow directly from RFC8446.
          </t>

          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>Authentication is the process of establishing the
            identity of one or more of the endpoints of a communication
            channel. TLS only requires authentication of the server side
            of the communication channel; authentication of the client
            side is optional.</li>
            <li>The term "confidentiality" describes a state where the
            data (i.e., the message) is transmitted in a way that it is
            only visible to the endpoints of a communication
            channel.</li>
          </ul>
          <t>It is not uncommon for implementers to use the term
          "encryption" to mean "confidentiality", but this is not quite
          correct. Rather, encryption using TLS is the current method by
          which confidentiality is achieved with SMTP, but that does not
          mean that future methods might not be developed.</t>
          <t>Note that with typical email use of TLS, authentication only is
          performed for the target receiving server and is not done for
          the sending client. That is, it serves to validate that the
          connection has been made to the intended server, but does not
          validate who initiated it.</t>
        </section> <!-- TLS -->
      <section numbered="true" anchor="opp-tls" toc="default">
        <name>Opportunistic Confidentiality</name>
        <t>The most common implementation of message confidentiality
          is what's known as "opportunistic TLS", which is frequently
          referred to as "opportunistic encryption". With this method,
          a receiving server announces in its greeting that it is
          capable of supporting TLS encryption through the presence of
          the "STARTTLS" keyword. The sending client then attempts to
          negotiate an encrypted connection, and if successful,
          transmits the message in encrypted form; if negotiation
          fails, the client falls back to sending the message in clear
          text.</t>

          <t>Opportunistic TLS is optional confidentiality due
          to the ability to fall back to transmission in the clear if
          a secure connection cannot be established.
          Opportunistic TLS is often configured to provide
          confidentiality without authentication, where no effort is
          made to authenticate the receiving server
          <xref target="RFC3207" section="4.1" sectionFormat="comma"/>.
          Most modern implementations of SMTP support this method
          and so the vast
          majority of email traffic is encrypted during its time
          transiting from the client to the server.</t>

          <t>Note that opportunistic TLS via the
          <xref target="RFC3207">STARTTLS</xref> extension is
          vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
          <xref target="enforced-tls">Enforced confidentiality</xref>
          can be used to mitigate these attacks.</t>

          <t>Also, note that while TLS provides protection while the message is
          in transit, there is no guarantee that the message will be
          stored in encrypted fashion at its destination. In fact,
          storage in plain text should be expected!
          Also, in a situation where a message traverses multiple hops
          through multiple SMTP servers, each intermediate server will
          have access to the plain text of the message.
<!--          The only way to completely assure confidentiality so that no
          one server has access to the-->
          The only way to prevent any of the intermediate
          servers from having access to the plain text
          contents of a message is to use message-level
          confidentiality as described in <xref target="message-conf"/>.</t>

      <section numbered="true" anchor="enforced-tls" toc="default">
        <name>Enforced Confidentiality,
        with Receiving Server Authentication</name>
        <t>Two protocols exist that move message confidentiality
          from opportunistic to enforced (with conditions as noted below) -
          <xref target="RFC8461">MTA-STS</xref> and
          <xref target="RFC7672">DANE for SMTP</xref>.
          While they differ in their implementation details, receiving
          servers relying on either protocol are stating that they
          only accept mail if the transmission can be encrypted with
          TLS, and a failure to negotiate a secure connection MUST
          result in the sending client refusing to transmit the
          message. Support for both protocols is increasing, but is
          not yet mandatory.</t>
        <t>These two protocols differ from Opportunistic TLS in that
          they require receiving server authentication and there is no
          fallback to sending in the clear if negotiation of an
        encrypted connection fails.</t>

        <t>However, as noted in <xref target="opp-tls"/>,
        both SMTP servers will most likely have access to the plain
        text of the message, as will all SMTP servers where multiple
        hops are involved.
        Again, only message-level confidentiality
        described in <xref target="message-conf"/> will prevent
<!--        that lack of confidentiality.-->
        those SMTP servers from having access to the plain text
        content of the message.
        </t>

        <t>Note that both protocols mentioned in this section rely not
          only on the receiving server but also the sending client
          supporting the protocol intended to be used. If the sending
          client does not implement or understand the protocol
          requested by the receiving server, the sending client will
          use Opportunistic TLS or clear-text to transmit the
          message.</t>

          Applicability Statement, nothing could be further from the
          truth.</t>
        <t>SMTP AUTH defines a method for a client to identify
          itself to a Message Submission Agent (MSA) when presenting a
          message for transmission, usually using ports 465 or 587 rather than
          the traditional port 25. The most common implementation of
          SMTP AUTH is for a person to present a username and password
          to their mailbox provider's outbound SMTP server when
        configuring their MUA for sending mail.</t>
        <t>SMPT AUTH MAY be used to limit unauthorized use of VRFY and

          and <xref target="RFC9580">OpenPGP</xref> exist to allow for
          message confidentiality outside of the operation of
          SMTP. That is to say, using these protocols results in
          encryption of the message prior to its being submitted to
          the SMTP communications channel, and decryption of the
          message is the responsibility of the message
          recipient. There are numerous implementations of these
          protocols, too many to list here. As they operate fully

        <name>Confidentiality Requirements</name>
        <t>The vast majority of email sent on the Internet at present
        does not use message-level confidentiality. It has been
        recognized that Internet traffic is exposed to both active
        attack and passive monitoring
        (see <xref target="RFC3365">BCP61</xref>,
        <xref target="RFC1984">BCP200</xref>), and therefore that
        message transmission over SMTP is subject to both.
        To mitigate these risks, opportunistic confidentiality is now
        widely implemented and used in Internet email, and some
        deployment and use of enforced confidentiality is also now
        seen. Therefore, confidentiality (for example, the STARTTLS
        extension) MUST be implemented by SMTP servers in order to at
        least provide over-the-wire confidentiality during an
        individual SMTP exchange. That said, there are many legacy
        implementations of SMTP that are still in widespread use in
        both private and Internet-connected networks, and most
        receiving servers implementations will be expected to be
        capable of receiving such messages. Therefore, SMTP servers
        MUST be configurable to allow for receiving messages without
        confidentiality between servers in order to maximize

      over headers or what (non-trace) headers may reasonably be
      altered in transit, that may be more appropriate to other
      sections than to any of the three suggested above.</t>

      <t>The Emailcore group arose out of discussions on the
        ietf-smtp group over changes and additions that should be made
        to the core email protocols.
        It was agreed upon that it was time to create a working group
        that would fix many potential errors and opportunities for
        misunderstandings within the RFCs.</t>

	  Special note should be taken of the interaction between 
	  confidentiality and authentication mechanism that are applicable
	  to Internet links and therefore potentially sensitive to the
	  multi-hop design of SMTP.  Unless the relevant messages and
	  mechanisms are protected from tampering or content exposure on
	  systems that are the endpoints of those links, the security of
	  the mechanisms depends on trust in those intermediate
	  endpoints. </t>
