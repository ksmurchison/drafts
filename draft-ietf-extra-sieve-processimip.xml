      Sieve email filtering language.
      The "processcalendar" extension gives Sieve the ability to process

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>Users frequently receive invites, replies, and cancellations
      for events, tasks, etc. via Internet mail messages.
      It is sometimes desirable to have such messages automatically
      parsed and the enclosed calendar data
      added to, updated on, or deleted from the user's calendars.</t>

      <t>Typically such messages are based on the
      <xref target="RFC6047" format="default">iCalendar Message-Based
      Interoperability Protocol (iMIP)</xref>.
      However, sometimes the enclosed
      <xref target="RFC5545">iCalendar</xref> data does not include an
      iTIP method property
      (see <xref target="RFC5546" section="1.4" sectionFormat="comma"/>),
      or the enclosed data may be in some other machine-readable format
<!--      (E.g. <xref target="I-D.ietf-calext-jscalendarbis">-->
      (E.g. <xref target="RFC8984">
      JSCalendar</xref>).
      </t>

      <t>This document defines an extension to the
      <xref target="RFC5228" format="default">Sieve language</xref>
      that enables scripts to process machine-readable calendar data
      that is encapsulated in an email message using
      <xref target="RFC2045">MIME</xref>.
      Specifically, this extension provides the ability to alter
      items on a user's calendars referenced in the encapsulated
      calendar data.</t>

Usage: processcalendar [ :allowpublic ]
                       [ :addresses <string-list> ]
                       [ :updatesonly / :calendarid <string> ]

                       [ :outcome <variablename: string> ]
                       [ :reason <variablename: string> ]
]]></artwork>

      <t>The "processcalendar" action is used to parse encapsulated
      calendar data and perform the appropriate action based on the
      content.
      If the calendar data is malformed in any way, it MUST be ignored
      and no action is taken.
      Otherwise, based on the iTIP method
      (see <xref target="RFC5546" section="1.4" />)
      of the message, calendar objects are created, updated, or
      deleted from a given calendar.</t>

      <t>This action can be used with or without the
      <xref target="RFC6134">"extlists"</xref> extension.
      When the "extlists" extension is enabled in a script using
      &lt;require "extlists"&gt;, the script can use the
      <xref target="organizers">:organizers</xref> argument to the
      "processcalendar" action as described below.
      When the "extlists" extension is not enabled, the :organizers
      argument MUST NOT be used and MUST cause an error
      according to <xref target="RFC5228" />.</t>

      <t>This action can be used with or without the
      <xref target="RFC5229">"variables"</xref> extension.
      When the "variables" extension is enabled in a script using
      &lt;require "variables"&gt;, the script can use the
      <xref target="outcome">:outcome</xref> and 
      <xref target="reason">:reason</xref> arguments to the
      "processcalendar" action as described below.
      When the "variables" extension is not enabled, the :outcome
      and :reason arguments MUST NOT be used and MUST cause an error
      according to <xref target="RFC5228" />.</t>

      <t>If a mail messages contains calendar data in multiple
      <xref target="RFC2045">MIME</xref> parts, this action MUST
      verify that the calendar data in each part are semantically
      equivalent to one another.  If the data is found to be
      semantically different, the action MUST NOT process the message.
      Otherwise, the action MUST only process one representation of
      the data.</t>

      <t>This action MUST NOT make any changes to the participant
      status of the recipient when processing the calendar data.
      The mechanism for a recipient to change their participant status
      to an event is out of scope for this document.</t>

      <t>This action SHOULD remove alarms from calendar data
      before applying it to a calendar.</t>

        The <xref target="RFC5235">spamtest and virustest</xref>
        extensions (or the <xref target="RFC5228">header</xref> test
        if messages are scanned outside of the Sieve

        data received from a known sender.
        The <xref target="RFC5228">address and envelope</xref> tests
        (optionally along with the <xref target="RFC6134">extlists</xref>
        extension) can be used to create an "allow list" and make
        processcalendar conditional on the sender being a member of
        that list.</li>

        <li>Processcalendar SHOULD NOT process calendar data received
        from an untrustworthy sender.  Trustworthiness may depend on
        whether the message has a valid signature (see
        <xref target="RFC8551"/>) and/or on whether one or more of
        <xref target="RFC7208">Sender Policy Framework (SPF)</xref>,
        <xref target="RFC6376">DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)
        Signatures</xref>,
        <xref target="RFC7489">Domain-based Message Authentication,
        Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)</xref> passes or fails on
        the message.
        The mechanism by which a Sieve interpreter accesses the results of
        such checks is outside the scope of this document, but if the
        results are available in the message's header fields,
        the <xref target="RFC5228">header</xref> test can be used to make
        processcalendar conditional on the sender being trustworthy.</li>
      </ul>

      <t>Additionally, if the calendar data has embedded (a.k.a. inline)
      attachments, implementations SHOULD:</t>

      <ul>
        <li>Decode the embedded attachment, if necessary.</li>

        <li>Scan the (decoded) attachment for malicious content.</li>
      </ul>

      <t>If an attachment is found to be malicious, processcalendar
      MUST NOT process the calendar data.</t>
