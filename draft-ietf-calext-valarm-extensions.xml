      <t>This document defines a set of extensions to the iCalendar
      VALARM component to enhance use of alarms and improve
      interoperability between clients and servers.</t>

    </abstract>

  <middle>
    <section title='Introduction'>
      <t>The <xref target="RFC5545">iCalendar</xref> specification
      defines a set of components used to describe calendar data. One
      of those is the "VALARM" component which appears as a
      sub-component of "VEVENT" and "VTODO" components. The "VALARM"
      component is used to specify a reminder for an event or
      task. Different alarm actions are possible, as are different
      ways to specify how the alarm is triggered.</t>

      <t>As iCalendar has become more widely used and as client-server
      protocols such as <xref target="RFC4791">CalDAV</xref> have
      become more prevalent, several issues with "VALARM" components
      have arisen. Most of these relate to the need to extend the
      existing "VALARM" component with new properties and behaviors to
      allow clients and servers to accomplish specific tasks in an
      interoperable manner. For example, clients typically need a way
      to specify that an alarm has been dismissed by a calendar user,
      or has been "snoozed" by a set amount of time. To date, this has
      been done through the use of custom "X-" properties specific to
      each client implementation, leading to poor
      interoperability.</t>

      <t>This specification defines a set of extensions to "VALARM"
      components to cover common requirements for alarms not currently
      addressed in iCalendar. Each extension is defined in a separate
      section below. For the most part, each extension can be
      supported independently of the others, though in some cases one
      extension will require another. In addition, this specification
      describes mechanisms by which clients can interoperably
      implement common features such as "snoozing".</t>

    <section title='Conventions Used in This Document'>
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
      "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
      described in BCP&nbsp;14
      <xref target='RFC2119' /> <xref target='RFC8174' /> 
      when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

      <t>When XML element types in the namespaces "DAV:" and
      "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:caldav" are referenced in this document
      outside of the context of an XML fragment, the string "DAV:" and
      "CALDAV:" will be prefixed to the element type names
      respectively.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Extensible syntax for VALARM" anchor="syntax">
      <t>Section 3.6.6 of <xref target="RFC5545" /> defines the syntax
      for "VALARM" components and properties within them. However, as
      written, it is hard to extend this by adding, e.g., a new
      property common to all types of alarm. Since many of the
      extensions defined in this document need to extend the base
      syntax, an alternative form for the base syntax is defined here,
      with the goal of simplifying specification of the
      extensions.</t>

      <t>A "VALARM" calendar component is re-defined by the following notation:

    <section title="Alarm Unique Identifier" anchor="uid">
      <t>This extension adds a "UID"
      property to "VALARM" components to allow a unique identifier to
      be specified. The value of this property can then be used to refer
      uniquely to the "VALARM" component.</t> 

      <t>The "UID" property defined here follows the definition in
      Section 3.8.4.7 of <xref target="RFC5545" /> with the security
      and privacy updates in Section 5.3 of <xref target="RFC7986" />.
      In particular it MUST be a globally unique identifier that does
      not contain any security- or privacy-sensitive information.</t> 

      <t>The "VALARM" component defined in <xref target="syntax" /> is
      extended here as:

]]></artwork>

    </section>

    <section title="Alarm Related To">
      <t>It is often convenient to relate one or more "VALARM"
      components to other "VALARM" components (e.g., see <xref
      target="snooze"/>). This can be accomplished if the "VALARM"
      components each have their own "UID" property (as per <xref
      target="uid" />).</t>

      <t>This specification updates the usage of the "RELATED-TO"
      property defined in Section 3.8.4.5 of <xref target="RFC5545" />
      to enable its use with "VALARM" components. Specific types of
      relationships between "VALARM" components can be identified by
      registering new values for the "RELTYPE" property parameter
      defined in Section 3.2.15 of <xref target="RFC5545" />.</t>

      <t>The "VALARM" component defined in <xref target="syntax" /> is
      extended here as:

    </section>

    <section title="Alarm Acknowledgement">
      <t>There is currently no way for a "VALARM" component to
      indicate whether it has been triggered and acknowledged. With
      the advent of a standard client/server protocol for calendaring
      and scheduling data (<xref target="RFC4791" />) it is quite
      possible for an event with an alarm to exist on multiple clients
      in addition to the server. If each of those is responsible for
      performing the action when an alarm triggers, then multiple
      "alerts" are generated by different devices. In such a
      situation, a calendar user would like to be able to "dismiss"
      the alarm on one device and have it automatically dismissed on
      the others too.</t>
      <t>Also, with recurring events that have alarms, it is important
      to know when the last alarm in the recurring set was
      acknowledged, so that the client can determine whether past
      alarms have been missed.</t>
      <t>To address these needs, this specification adds an
      "ACKNOWLEDGED" property to "VALARM" components to indicate when
      the alarm was last sent or acknowledged. This is defined by the
      syntax below.

            <t hangText="Description:">This property is used to
            specify when an alarm was last sent or acknowledged. This
            allows clients to determine when a pending alarm has been
            acknowledged by a calendar user so that any alerts can be
            dismissed across multiple devices. It also allows clients
            to track repeating alarms or alarms on recurring events or
            to-dos to ensure that the right number of missed alarms
            can be tracked.</t>
            <t>Clients SHOULD set this property to the current
            date-time value in UTC when a calendar user acknowledges a
            pending alarm.
            Certain kinds of alarms, such as email-based alerts, might
            not provide feedback as to when the calendar user sees them.
            For those kinds of alarms, the
            client SHOULD set this property when the alarm is
            triggered and the action successfully carried out.
            <vspace blankLines="1" />When an alarm is triggered on a
            client, clients can check to see if an "ACKNOWLEDGED"
            property is present. If it is, and the value of that
            property is greater than or equal to the computed trigger
            time for the alarm, then the client SHOULD NOT trigger the
            alarm. Similarly, if an alarm has been triggered and an
            "alert" presented to a calendar user, clients can monitor
            the iCalendar data to determine whether an "ACKNOWLEDGED" property
            is added or changed in the alarm component. If the value
            of any "ACKNOWLEDGED" property in the alarm changes and is greater
            than or equal to the trigger time of the alarm, then
            clients SHOULD dismiss or cancel any "alert" presented to
            the calendar user.</t>

    <section title="Snoozing Alarms" anchor="snooze">
      <t>Users often want to "snooze" an alarm, and this specification
      defines a standard approach to accomplish that.</t>
      <t>To "snooze" an alarm, clients create a new "VALARM" component
      within the parent component of the "VALARM" that was triggered
      and is being "snoozed" (i.e., as a "sibling" component of the
      "VALARM" being snoozed). The new "VALARM" MUST be set to trigger
      at the user's chosen "snooze" interval after the original alarm
      triggered. Clients SHOULD use an absolute "TRIGGER" property
      with a "DATE-TIME" value specified in UTC.</t>

      <t>Clients MUST add a
      "RELATED-TO" property to the new "VALARM" component with a value
      set to the "UID" property value of the "VALARM" component being
      snoozed. If the "VALARM" component being snoozed does not
      already have a "UID" property, the client MUST add one. The
      "RELATED-TO" property added to the new "VALARM" component MUST
      include a "RELTYPE" property parameter with a value set to
      "SNOOZE".</t>

      <t>When the "snooze" alarm is triggered and dismissed the client
      MUST do one of the following with the corresponding "VALARM" component:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Set the "ACKNOWLEDGED" property
        (see <xref target="ACKNOWLEDGED"/>)</t>
        <t>Remove the component</t>
      </list>
<!--
      <t>When the "snooze" alarm is triggered and dismissed the client
      MUST either set the "ACKNOWLEDGED" property
      (see <xref target="ACKNOWLEDGED"/>) on the corresponding
      "VALARM" component, or remove the corresponding component.
-->
      Alternatively, if the "snooze" alarm
      is itself "snoozed", the client MUST remove the original
      "snooze" alarm and create a new one, with the appropriate
      trigger time and relationship set.</t>

      <t>Note that regardless of the final disposition of the "snooze"
      alarm when triggered, the original "VALARM" component is left
      unchanged.</t>

      <section title="Relationship Type Property Parameter" anchor="SNOOZE-PARAM">
        <t>
            This specification adds the "SNOOZE" relationship type for
            use with the "RELTYPE" property defined in Section 3.2.15
            of <xref target="RFC5545" />. This is used when relating a
            "snoozed" "VALARM" component to the original alarm that
            the "snooze" was generated for.

    <section title="Alarm Proximity Trigger">
      <t>VALARMs are currently triggered when a specific date-time is
      reached. It is also desirable to be able to trigger alarms based
      on location, e.g. when arriving at or departing from a
      particular location.</t>
      <t>This specification adds the following properties to "VALARM"
      components to indicate when an alarm can be triggered based on
      location.
      <list>
        <t>"PROXIMITY" - indicates that a location based trigger is to
        be used and which direction of motion is used for the

        location to trigger off, specified using a <xref

        coordinate values with an optional uncertainty</t>

      <t>
        Typically, when a "PROXIMITY" property is used there is no
        need to specify a time-based trigger using the "TRIGGER"
        property. However, since "TRIGGER" is defined as a required
        property for a "VALARM" component, for backwards compatibility
        it has to be present, but ignored. To indicate a "TRIGGER"
        that is to be ignored, clients SHOULD use a value a long time
        in the past. A value of "19760401T005545Z" has been commonly
        used for this purpose.

            <t hangText="Description:">This property is used to
            indicate that an alarm has a location-based trigger. Its
            value identifies the direction of motion used to trigger
            the alarm. One or more location values are set using
            "STRUCTURED-LOCATION" properties.</t>

            <t>When the property value is set to "ARRIVE", the alarm
            is triggered when the calendar user agent arrives in the
            vicinity of any of the specified locations. When set to
            "DEPART", the alarm is triggered when the calendar user
            agent departs from the vicinity of any specified
            locations.  Note that the meaning of "vicinity" in this
            context is implementation defined.</t>

            <t>When the property value is set to "CONNECT", the alarm
            is triggered when the calendar user agent connects to an
            automobile that is enabled for
            <xref target="BTcore">Bluetooth(R)</xref>.
            When set to "DISCONNECT", the alarm is
            triggered when the calendar user agent disconnects from an
            automobile that is enabled for Bluetooth(R).</t>

    <section title='Security Considerations'>
      <t>VALARMs, if not monitored properly, can be used to "spam"
      users and/or leak personal information.  For instance, an
      unwanted audio or display alert could be considered spam.  Or an
      email alert could be used to leak a user&apos;s location to a third
      party or to send unsolicited email to multiple users.
      Therefore, CalDAV clients and servers that accept iCalendar data
      from a third party (e.g. via <xref target="RFC5546">iTIP</xref>,
      a subscription feed, or a shared calendar) SHOULD remove all
      VALARMs from the data prior to storing in their calendar system.</t>
    </section>

    <section title='Privacy Considerations'>
      <t>Proximity VALARMs, if not used carefully, can leak a
      user&apos;s past, present, or future location.  For instance,
      storing an iCalendar resource containing proxmity VALARMs to a
      shared calendar on CalDAV server can expose to anyone that has
      access to that calendar the user&apos;s intent to leave
      from or arrive at a particular location at some future time.
      Furthermore, if a CalDAV client updates the shared iCalendar
      resource with an ACKNOWLEDGED property when the alarm is
      triggered, will leak the exact date and time that the user left
      from or arrived at the location.
      
      Therefore, CalDAV clients that implement proximity alarms
      SHOULD give users the option of storing and/or acknowledging the
      alarms on the local device only and not storing the alarm and/or
      acknowledgment on a remote server.</t>
